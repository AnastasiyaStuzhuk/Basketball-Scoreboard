# Basketball-Scoreboard:basketball:
Basketball-Scoreboard's the first solo project for [JavaScript course on scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). It's a very simple project where was used knowledge about variables, data types such as strings and numbers, simple functions without arguments and methods like getElementById(), innerText and textContent. We also have considered the DOM. This project was created with additional requirements such as adding a "New Game" button, highlighting the leaders, adding a shadow to the scoreboard container, added some changes on hover and focus for buttons.

# Basketball-Scoreboard:basketball:
Basketball-Scoreboard's the first solo project for [JavaScript course on scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). It's a very simple project where was used knowledge about variables, data type such as strings and numbers, simple functions without arguments and methods like getElementById(), innerText and textContent. We also have considered the DOM. This project was created with additional requrements such as added a "New Game" button, highlited the leaders, added shadow to scoreboard container, added some changes on hover and focus for buttons.
